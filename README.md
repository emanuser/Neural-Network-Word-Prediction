# Neural-Network-Word-Prediction
RNN-LSTM and interface for NLP word prediction with R programming language 

This is a word prediction model that runs on a RNN-LSTM built in the R-programming language. Rather then explicitly programming a set of language rules, a RNN was implemented in order to learn and generalize patterns that naturally occur in English.
